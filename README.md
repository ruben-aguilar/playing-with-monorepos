# Playing with monorepos

In this repository I play with different options to implement a monorepo with the following characteristics: 
- It contains apps, packages and backend services
- Commands to build and start the apps are as easy as possible
- It supports hot reloading for all the apps and packages, when something changes, it's automatically reloaded independtly of the type of project
- I can launch the whole app with one command
